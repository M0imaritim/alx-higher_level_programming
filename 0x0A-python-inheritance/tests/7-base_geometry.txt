This is a class with two methods.

 >>> BaseGeometry = __import__('7-base_geometry').BaseGeometry

- Testing integer_validator() method:

1. Valid integer value:
    Name: "Length", Value: 10
    Expected outcome: No exceptions should be raised.

2. Non-integer value:
    Name: "Width", Value: 5.5
    Expected outcome: TypeError should be raised with the message "Width must be an integer".

3. Negative integer value:
    Name: "Height", Value: -3
    Expected outcome: ValueError should be raised with the message "Height must be greater than 0".

4. Zero value:
    Name: "Width", Value: 0
    Expected outcome: ValueError should be raised with the message "Width must be greater than 0".

5. String value:
    Name: "Radius", Value: "abc"
    Expected outcome: TypeError should be raised with the message "Radius must be an integer".

6. None value:
    Name: "Length", Value: None
    Expected outcome: TypeError should be raised with the message "Length must be an integer".

7. Large integer value:
    Name: "Length", Value: 99999999999999999999999999999999
    Expected outcome: No exceptions should be raised.

8. Boundary case: Smallest positive integer value:
    Name: "Width", Value: 1
    Expected outcome: No exceptions should be raised.

9. Boundary case: Largest positive integer value (within system limits):
    Name: "Height", Value: 2147483647 (maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer)
    Expected outcome: No exceptions should be raised.
